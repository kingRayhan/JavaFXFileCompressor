## File Compressor GUI Application
This javafx based gui application can encode a text file via huffman algorithm and save to a file with extension `.ez`. Also can retrieve back to original text file by extractor.

## Workflow
**Compress a text file**
1. When you will click choose file button from `Compress` tab then a file browser will open by which you can only select a `*.txt` extension file. After selecting a text file from file browser, file that source file location will be shown on beside text field.
2. Then you need to click the `Compress` button bellow and a file browser will open. You will select a path for saving that file. File will be save in `.ez` extension automatically.
3. An alertbox will popup after successfully compress the file where you can see success message with file save location.


**Extract a text file**
1. When you will click choose file button from `Extract` tab then a file browser will open by which you can only select a `*.ez` extension file. After selecting a text file from file browser, file that source file location will be shown on beside text field.
2. Then you need to click the `Extract` button bellow and a file browser will open. You will select a path for saving that file. File will be save in `.txt` extension automatically. That is the actual restored file from compression.
3. An alertbox will popup after successfully extract the file where you can see success message with file save location.
